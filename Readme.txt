Hello,
I am Aral Yucel welcome to my data mining project,
In the project I tried to implement SVDpp, SVD and NMF algorithms to find out which one is a better choice and I conclude that 
SVDpp is giving lower rmse so I made tests about the hyper parameters to find out which parameters are giving beter result.
You can read information below to succesfully run and see my output file. 

Befor running <<Movie_rec_system.py>> make sure to install python 3.6.x and
install the following library.

pip install pandas
pip install surprise

If there is an error while installing surprise library make sure that you installed
Visual studio c++ 14.0 tools you can read the instructions to be able to download if needed => https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers

After installing python 3.6.x and the libraries you can run:

python Movie_rec_system.py 
#Runing time can be approximately 5-6 mins

After it run it will give an output which is called submit_sample.txt
